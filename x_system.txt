The X system is a way of integrating data into C code using the C preprocessor.
Data is defined in .x files, .y files use the C preprocessor to transform that
data into C code which is stored in .z files.

Data that appears once per object is defined using #define symbols. For example,
thing.x might have these two properties.

#define XNAME thing
#define XDESC "This is a thing!"

At the start of every object the XSTART() macro is called and at the end the
XEND() macro is called. The .y files should implement these macros to produce
valid C code.

There are a number of standardized header files in any X system directory. These
are:

* _defaults.x - Defines default implementation functions such as XSTART()
  and XEND() that produce no C code.
* _reset.x - Undefines any implementation macros.
* _before.x - This is included before any .x file, it usually just calls
  XSTART()
* _after.x - This is included after any .x files. It calls XEND(), but also
  undefines any properties the .x file may have defined. It gives a clean slate
  to the next .x file.

The possible implementation and properties are defined in a .xsys file.
