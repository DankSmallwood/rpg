A roguelite with lifepath character generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Character Generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each new character is spawned into a persistent world. Character generation is
its own minigame, through a series of choices you guide your character through
their early life until they hear the call of adventure and you take control. You
may be born as a peasant in a city, join the city guard, fight in a battle and
start from there. You could be an orc on the steppe, kidnapped by kobolds and
start just after fighting your way free. You could even _die_ during character
generation.

Draw Three, Choose One
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many things throughout the game are represented as stacks of cards. To play
these sections, you draw three cards which represent the choices you have
available to you and choose one card. On the back of the card is a table. Roll
3d6, apply any modifiers you might have from traits and look up in the table the
effect of the card. The card might give you a trait, tell you to draw again,
move you to another deck, or end the mini-game entirely.

Traits
~~~~~~

Character variety is achieved through a small number of stats combined with a
large number of traits. Traits are chosen at character generation, acquired
during lifepath, or awarded for positive or negative actions during play. More
than anything else, traits define who a character is.

Certain events may remove traits. For example, being seriously wounded might
give you the "Broken Leg" trait, but seeing a doctor could remove the trait.
Conversely, killing a tough enemy might give you the "Heroic Victory" trait, but
an enemy with psychic attacks might remove that memory from your mind, removing
the trait. Still others might just go away on their own, like the "Stunned"
trait.

Traits are like a combination of traits and perks in Fallout, but they're used
for everything. There are no special status effects, there are no perks, there
are no feats, there aren't even any skills, there are only traits. Everything is
a trait.

Statistics
~~~~~~~~~~

The focus of the game is on traits, but there are four stats that represent the
basic abilities of your player. These are:

* Vigor - Physical strength and endurance.
* Finesse - Dexterity, balance, hand-eye coordination.
* Intellect - Memory and other cognitive abilities.
* Spirit - Ability to commune with gods and other deities.

All these stats have a base value of 0 and are used as bonuses for die rolls and
as hard limits for equipment and actions. For example, a bow might require 1
vigor and will have a +finesse bonus, meaning you should add your finesse stat
to any die roll when shooting the bow.

Each race has its own set of default stats. An orc, for example, may get
vigor+2, finesse+1 and intellect-1. You aren't locked into typical fantasy
racial roles, though. Your orc character may be brought into the city as a
child, raised and educated (intellect+1), be employed as a merchant (another
intellect+1) and actually join the mage's college. The traits you acquire during
play define who your character is more than anything else.

Verbs and Nouns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Everything in the world is an object, including the player. Objects are nouns
which act through verbs. Verbs are actions, which could include anything from
"say" to "kill."

Tags
~~~~

All objects in the world have a set of tags associated with them. A sword might have
sharp, metal, steel, and short tags. When interacting with other objects, tags
define which objects might be compatible. Tags are a bit like "diet traits,"
they define what objects are in the worlds in a similar manner, but are much
simpler.

Say you want to perform the "push" action. The push action knows what it means
to push things like minecarts and buttons, so it will search through all the
objects in your inventory and in reach and come back with a set of objects for
you to choose from. Tags are what defines which nouns a verb can act on.

Races
~~~~~

There are many races in the world. These are typical fantasy races, plus many
others you wouldn't consider or might consider to be monsters and not playable
races. Each race has its own unique set of starting stats and traits that define
how the game will unfold.

* Human
* Elf
* Dwarf
* Gnome
* Orc
* Goblin
* Kobold
* Troll
* Ogre
* Ratman
