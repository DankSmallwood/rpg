A roguelite with lifepath character generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Character Generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each new character is spawned into a persistent world. Character generation is
its own minigame, through a series of choices you guide your character through
their early life until they hear the call of adventure and you take control. You
may be born as a peasant in a city, join the city guard, fight in a battle and
start from there. You could be an orc on the steppe, kidnapped by kobolds and
start just after fighting your way free. You could even _die_ during character
generation.

Draw Three, Choose One
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many things throughout the game are represented as stacks of cards. To play
these sections, you draw three cards which represent the choices you have
available to you and choose one card. On the back of the card is a table. Roll
3d6, apply any modifiers you might have from traits and look up in the table the
effect of the card. The card might give you a trait, tell you to draw again,
move you to another deck, or end the mini-game entirely.

Nouns, Adjectives and Verbs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Everything in the game is either a noun, adjective or verb. Anything physical in
the word is a noun. Bob, the dirty orc, is a noun, but so is a bat, a treasure
chest or the floor.

Nouns have properties that set them apart from other nouns. Bob, the dirty orc,
is smellier than a rock. These properties are represented as adjectives and all
nouns have a set of adjectives associated with them. Adjectives replace anything
in a typical game that could describe a noun, including the name of characters,
stats or characters and equipment, etc.

Adjectives often have parameters. For example, the "name" adjective will have a
string type parameter, or the "mass" adjective a mass in kilograms. These
adjectives are denoted using an equals sign, for example mass=100 or name=Bob.

Finally, verbs describe the interactions that nouns can have. Verbs take a
subject (the thing acting) and an object (the thing acted upon) and modify them
in some way. Each attribute has a way of modifying that action. For example,
imagine you have a rock with the mass=100 that you want to lift. The lift verb
will do a die roll, iterate through all the subject's adjectives any find any
bonuses to strength or lift (the base abilty and the specific action), and
compare that to the rock's arrributes of mass and lift.
